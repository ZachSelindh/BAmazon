A Node.js application using MySQL as a database for a fake shopping site.

This application uses MySQL as a database management application which interfaces with Node.js. The Node server is
set up to retrieve and alter the information on the database. 

I used the MySQL and Inquirer NPMs, and I added the Colors NPM to add a little varity to the information displayed on
the command line.

The assignment was to complete the Customer side application, but I decided to go after the Manager side app as a well, which
turned out to be even more fun.

Here's a youtube link to a demonstration of the CLI:
